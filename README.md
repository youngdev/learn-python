[Learn Python The Hard Way Book](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)
===============================


That was the way I found to learn Python, English and Git.

Rules:

1. Never copy and paste the code

2. Never use Google Translate

3. Push each exercise in the GitHub

> "Never stop learning"
